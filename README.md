The Liberty Communicator will be hardware and software device about the size of a small mobile phone that will allow friends and acquaintances (who periodically meet in person) to communicate using text messages securely, while away from each other. To keep the device simple and cheep, the device will only perform the encoding/decoding and entry/display of the text messages.

A host device such as mobile phone or computer will be needed to handle the transport of the already-encrypted messages. Security on the host will be less important as the messages will never exist in plane text form on either the host or network the host is connected to.
